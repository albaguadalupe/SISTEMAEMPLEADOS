# Pure CSS Menu Drawer w/ off-click üçî #CodePenChallenge

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/QxYMJa](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/QxYMJa).

Here's my submission for the Codepen `menus` challenge.

Nothing crazy but I wanted a pure CSS "off" click. It kinda bugs me a little when I __have__ to click the close icon to close the menu and I can't just click anywhere.

The trick here is to use a `checkbox` and when `:active` make the related label full screen.

Enjoy!
